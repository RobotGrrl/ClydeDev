![](http://robobrrd.com/images/clyde/clyde_robots.jpg)

Do you want to get started making your Clyde do interesting things? This library will provide you with the functions to get started!

For example, you can...

- Change the eye to an RGB or HSI colour
- Set the white light brightness
- Get the readings from the 'Afraid of the Dark' module
- Detect when a leg is touched and released (and know which leg it was!)
